# Operating Systems

In this report I will be going through a few operating systems, why they are useful and what the purpose of these operating system's are. In this report we will also be looking at the key features of the operating system and how the choice of the operating system affects the hardware and software requirements for the client. The two operating system's that will be compared in this report are Windows 10 and Mac OS X.


On July 29, 2015 Microsoft released a brand new operating system, this was Windows 10. This is part of the Windows NT family of operating system and is a successor to windows 8.1. Windows 10 is a closed source operating system, this means the source code is not accessble to the public, they cannot see it or make changes to it. 

**Windows OS kernel**
A computer program known as kernel is the main part of the the computer's operating system. The kernel has full control over everything in the system. Usually, after the bootloader this is one of the first programs to be loaded. It controls the rest of the start-up and also receives information from input and output, turning them into data-processing instructions for the CPU.

Windows 10 has a kernel type which is hybrid, this means it tries to have aspects and good features of both microkernel and monolithic kernel architectures. 

A microkernel is the near-minimum amount of software that can supply the mechanisms required to implement an operating system (OS). The mechanisms take into account low-level address space management, thread management, and inter-process communication (IPC). A monolithic kernel A monolithic kernel is an operating system architecture where the entire operating system is working in kernel space. The monolithic model differs from other operating system architectures (such as the microkernel architecture)[1][2] in that it alone defines a high-level virtual interface over computer hardware

The OS architecture known as monolithic kernel is where the whole operating system is operating in kernel space. This is different to architectures such as microkernel in that only it alone characterises a high-level virtual interface over PC equipment. 

**Application programming interface**

An application program interface (API) is an arrangement of schedules, conventions, and devices for building programming applications. An API determines how programming parts should talk to each other. Furthermore, APIs are utilised when programming GUI parts.







**Hardware requirements**

The client has a choice between choosing Windows 10 or Mac OS X. Here are the different set of hardware requirements for both operating systems. The client would need to meet these requirements so they can have the operating system of their choice.

**Windows 10**
 
 - Processor      :	 1 gigahertz (GHz)
 - RAM            :	 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit
 - Hard disk space:	 16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS
 - Graphics card  :	 DirectX 9 
 - Display        :	 800x600 pixels 
 
 **Mac OS X (Mac OS X v10.6)**
 - Processor      :  An Intel processor
 - RAM            :  At least 1 GB of RAM (additional RAM is recommended)
 - Graphics card  :  A built-in display or a display connected to an Apple-supplied video card supported by your computer
 - Hard disk space:  Hard at least 5 GB of disk space available, or 7 GB of disk space if you install the developer tools
