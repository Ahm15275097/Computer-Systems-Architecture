# Operating Systems

In this report I will be going through a few operating systems, why they are useful and what the purpose of these operating system's are. In this report we will also be looking at the key features of the operating system and how the choice of the operating system affects the hardware and software requirements for the client. The two operating system's that will be compared in this report are Windows 10 and Mac OS X.


On July 29, 2015 Microsoft released a brand new operating system, this was Windows 10. This is part of the Windows NT family of operating system and is a succesor to windows 8.1. Windows 10 is a closed source operating system, this means the source code is not accessble to the public, they cannot see it or make changes to it.
