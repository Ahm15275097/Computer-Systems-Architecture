# Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle 
This is a process where the computer obtains a program instruction from its memory, then it finds out what sort of actions the instructions is asking for, lastly it performs the action. This cycle happens again and again by the CPU from the boot up and stops when the computer has shut down.

Fetch

Firstly, the CPU retrieves some data and instructions, for example programs, from the main memory and holds them in registers. These registers where the information is stored in, are the CPU's temporary memory areas. The CPU uses something called an address bus. All this is, is a hardware path to the main memory. The CPU will look at the next item and it will store its address on the address bus. Then there is another hardware path known as the data bus. Here the data from the address will move from the main memory to the CPU.

Decode

The CPU is made to recognize a certain set of commands. These are known as the instruction set of the CPU. Different makes of the CPU have a different instruction set. The CPU will decode the information received and prepare many areas within the chip. This is to make it ready for the next step.

Execute 

In this section of the cycle the data will be processed. The instruction is taken place upon the data. The result of the process will be placed in another register. When this stage is complete, the CPU will begin another cycle.
